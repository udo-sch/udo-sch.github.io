# Redirecting Website

This repository contains a simple `index.html` file that redirects visitors to [https://merowech.github.io/](https://merowech.github.io/).

## How It Works

- The `index.html` uses a `<meta>` refresh tag to redirect users automatically.
- A JavaScript fallback (`window.location.href`) ensures redirection in case the meta refresh doesnâ€™t work.
- A manual link is also provided for users who may have JavaScript disabled.

## Why?

This repository exists solely to forward traffic to my main website on GitHub Pages.

## License

Feel free to use this setup if you need a simple redirect for your own project!
